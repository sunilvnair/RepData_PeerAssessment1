## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. 
These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their 
health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain
and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data 
consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken 
in 5 minute intervals each day.

## Prepare the R environment

Throughout this report when writing code chunks in the R markdown document, **always use echo = TRUE** so that someone else will be able to read the code. 

First, we set echo equal a **TRUE** and results equal a **'hold'** as global options for this document.  
```{r set_options}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, results = 'hold')
```

### Load required libraries
```{r call_libraries}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2) # we shall use ggplot2 for plotting figures
```


## Loading and preprocessing the data

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The 
data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps
 taken in 5 minute intervals each day.  

This assignment instructions request to show any code that is needed to loading and preprocessing the data, like to:  

1. Load the data (i.e. > <font color='red'>read.csv()</font>)  
2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r loaddata}
unzip(zipfile="activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
total.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
mean(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
averages <- aggregate(x=list(steps=data$steps), by=list(interval=data$interval),
                      FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot(data=averages, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("average number of steps taken")
```

On average across all the days in the dataset, the 5-minute interval contains
the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
averages[which.max(averages$steps),]
```

## Imputing missing values

There are many days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as `NA`). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

```{r how_many_missing}
missing <- is.na(data$steps)
# How many missing
table(missing)
```

All of the missing values are filled in with mean value for that 5-minute
interval.

```{r}
# Replace each missing value with the mean value of its 5-minute interval
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps))
        filled <- c(steps)
    else
        filled <- (averages[averages$interval==interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
filled.data <- data
filled.data$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.data$steps, filled.data$interval)
```
Now, using the filled data set, let's make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate the mean and median total number of steps.

```{r}
total.steps <- tapply(filled.data$steps, filled.data$date, FUN=sum)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
mean(total.steps)
median(total.steps)
```

Mean and median values are higher after imputing missing data. The reason is
that in the original data, there are some days with `steps` values `NA` for 
any `interval`. The total number of steps taken in such days are set to 0s by
default. However, after replacing missing `steps` values with the mean `steps`
of associated `interval` value, these 0 values are removed from the histogram
of total number of steps taken each day.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
First, let's find the day of the week for each measurement in the dataset. In
this part, we use the dataset with the filled-in values.

```{r}
weekday.or.weekend <- function(date) {
    day <- weekdays(date)
    if (day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"))
        return("weekday")
    else if (day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
        return("weekend")
    else
        stop("invalid date")
}
filled.data$date <- as.Date(filled.data$date)
filled.data$day <- sapply(filled.data$date, FUN=weekday.or.weekend)
```

Now, let's make a panel plot containing plots of average number of steps taken
on weekdays and weekends.
```{r}
averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data=filled.data, mean)
ggplot(averages, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(day ~ .) +
    xlab("5-minute interval") + ylab("Number of steps")
```
